## About Coding Grace
Coding Grace is a registered not-for-profit organisation. The organisation is inspired by a computer scientist and mathematician, Grace Hopper, who was a pioneer in computer programming.

Founded in 2012 by Vicky Twomey-Lee, Andrea Magnorsky, and Michael Twomey out of frustration from the lack of girls or women in tech events.

They decided to do something about it by providing diversity-friendly workshops and events in a safe environment for developers and aspiring developers mentored by diverse instructors from the industry.

Coding Grace tries to ensure their events are diverse, and encourage underserved folks who wants to mentor, and facilitate these technical sessions to help out, it's not that scary after all!

The team has more than a decadeâ€™s experience being involved with women in tech user groups based in Ireland such as PyLadies Dublin, Women Who Code Dublin as well as many more years experience in the professional tech industry.

Coding Grace aims to provide a support network for people from all backgrounds, and hope their outreach will help bring those who are interested in code development together and learn from one another.
